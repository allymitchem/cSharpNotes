## C# Syntax Basics

C# allows you to insert as much space as you would like between commands that you write.  You can use tabs or spaces to format your C# code to make it easier for us humans to read.  Complete lines of code, or **statements**, need to end with a semicolon so that the C# **compiler** knows that we have completed giving it an instruction.

A **compiler** turns our C# statements into a file that a computer can execute.

Let's write our first line of C# code, a simple "hello world" statement in C#:

Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
