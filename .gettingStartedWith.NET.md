## C# Syntax Basics

C# allows you to insert as much space as you would like between commands that you write.  You can use tabs or spaces to format your C# code to make it easier for us humans to read.  Complete lines of code, or **statements**, need to end with a semicolon so that the C# **compiler** knows that we have completed giving it an instruction.

A **compiler** turns our C# statements into a file that a computer can execute.

Let's write our first line of C# code, a simple "hello world" statement in C#:

Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");

Let's review what happened there.  **Console.WriteLine** is an instruction that tells C# to write the contents of the parenthesis **( )**. We include some text, referred to as a **string** enclosed in double-quotes that we would like C# to write for us.

## Introducing Variables

We can instruct C# to store values in memory using **variables**.  A variable can store a value that we **assign** to it using the `=` operator.  

Let's define a variable of type `string` called `aFriend` and store the name "Bill".  

string aFriend = "Bill";
Console.WriteLine(aFriend);

You can also re-assign different values to a variable, like so:

aFriend = "Maira";
Console.WriteLine(aFriend);

## Work with strings

The data type used above is called a `string`. It's used for textual data.

You can also combine strings. In this case, we'll use `+` to combine two strings:

Console.WriteLine("Hello " + aFriend);

When working with strings, you can also use [String Interpolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated) to combine values into a string:

Console.WriteLine($"Hello {aFriend}");

You're not limited to a single variable between the curly braces when using String Interpolation:

string firstFriend = "Maria";

string secondFriend = "Sage";

Console.WriteLine($"My friends are {firstFriend} and {secondFriend}");

As you explore more with strings, you'll find that strings are more than a collection of letters. You can find the length of a string using `Length`. `Length` is a property of a string and it returns the number of characters in that string:

Console.WriteLine($"The name {firstFriend} has {firstFriend.Length} letters.");

Console.WriteLine($"The name {secondFriend} has {secondFriend.Length} letters.");

## Do more with strings

You've been using a *method*, `Console.WriteLine`, to print messages. A method is a block of code that implements some action. It has a name, so you can access it.

Suppose your strings have leading or trailing spaces that you don't want to display. You want to **trim** the spaces from the strings. The `Trim` method and related methods `TrimStart` and `TrimEnd` do that work. You can just use those methods to remove leading and trailing spaces.

string greeting = "      Hello World!       ";

Console.WriteLine($"[{greeting}]");

string trimmedGreeting = greeting.TrimStart();

Console.WriteLine($"[{trimmedGreeting}]");

trimmedGreeting = greeting.TrimEnd();

Console.WriteLine($"[{trimmedGreeting}]");

trimmedGreeting = greeting.Trim();

Console.WriteLine($"[{trimmedGreeting}]");

There are other methods available to work with a string. For example, you've probably used a search and replace command in an editor or word processor before. The `Replace` method does something similar in a string. It searches for a substring and replaces it with different text. The `Replace` method takes two parameters. These are the strings between the parentheses. The first string is the text to search for. The second string is the text to replace it with:

string sayHello = "Hello World!";

Console.WriteLine(sayHello);

sayHello = sayHello.Replace("Hello", "Greetings");

Console.WriteLine(sayHello);

Two other useful methods make a string ALL CAPS or all lower case:

Console.WriteLine(sayHello.ToUpper());

Console.WriteLine(sayHello.ToLower());

## Search strings

The other part of a search and replace operation is to find text in a string. You can use the `Contains` method for searching. It tells you if a string contains a substring inside it:

string songLyrics = "You say goodbye, and I say hello";
Console.WriteLine(songLyrics.Contains("goodbye"));
Console.WriteLine(songLyrics.Contains("greetings"));

## Comments

You can write comments by using the two forward-slash characters to indicate everything after them is a comment.

// This is a comment

The below script needs to be able to find the current output cell; this is an easy method to get it.

You can create comments that span multiple lines by using slash asterisk fencing like the following:

/*
This is a multi-line comment

and this is still commented out
*/

## Built-In Variable Types

Variables can be declared of various **types** and then interacted with. The simplest types in C# are called [Built-In Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types)

We define variables using in-memory storage for a type by preceeding the name of the variable we would like to create with the type of the variable we are creating.

int i = 10;

                        double j = 5.5d;

      char c = 'C';

c

### The var keyword

Sometimes, its a little cumbersome to declare a variable, assign a value, and have to specify the type before it. C# has built-in type inference and you can use the var keyword to force the compiler to detect the actual type being created and set the variable to the type of the value being assigned.

var i                             = 10;

var someReallyLongVariableName    = 9;

var foo                           = "Something";

display(someReallyLongVariableName);

var c = 'C';

c

You can ONLY use the var keyword when creating and assigning the variable in one statement.

### Real Literals

We can declare double, float, and decimal types with simple numeric notation, but we need to force the literal numbers we assign to be the correct type to match the variable type expected.

To do this, we add a d, f, or m suffix to a number being assigned.  Try changing the suffix on the number in the next block and see what types it assigns.

var myNumber = 4f;

myNumber.GetType()
